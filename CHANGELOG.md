### Fixed

- Fixed benchmark HEX field validation in `ngdp-bpsv`:
  - Corrected hex string lengths in benchmarks to match field byte requirements
  - HEX:32 now correctly uses 64 hex characters (32 bytes)
  - HEX:16 now correctly uses 32 hex characters (16 bytes)

### Changed

#### Breaking Changes

- **Changed default protocol version to V2 for both Ribbit and TACT clients**:
  - `RibbitClient::new()` now defaults to `ProtocolVersion::V2` (was V1)
  - `HttpClient::default()` now uses `ProtocolVersion::V2` (was V1)
  - V2 provides better performance and is the modern protocol
  - To use V1, explicitly set it: `.with_protocol_version(ProtocolVersion::V1)`
  - Updated FallbackClient to use V2 for TACT fallback
  - Certificate and OCSP endpoints automatically use V1 (V2 not supported for these)
  - Added `Clone` trait to `RibbitClient` for protocol version switching

### Fixed

#### `ngdp-bpsv` crate

- **Fixed HEX field length interpretation to match Blizzard's semantics**:
  - HEX:N now correctly represents N bytes in binary format (N*2 hex characters)
  - Previously interpreted HEX:16 as 16 characters, now correctly expects 32 characters
  - This aligns with Blizzard's actual data format where HEX:16 = 16-byte MD5 hash
  - Updated all tests to use correct hex string lengths
  - Updated documentation to clarify field length semantics

#### `ribbit-client` crate

- **Removed HEX field length adjustment workaround**:
  - Removed `adjust_hex_field_lengths` function that was compensating for BPSV parser issue
  - Now parses BPSV responses directly without field manipulation
  - Simplifies code and improves reliability

### Added

#### `ngdp-client` crate

- **Added automatic Ribbit to TACT fallback**:
  - New `FallbackClient` that tries Ribbit first (primary protocol)
  - Automatically falls back to TACT HTTP if Ribbit fails
  - Both protocols return identical BPSV data
  - Transparent caching for both protocols
  - SG region automatically maps to US for TACT (not supported)
  - All product commands now benefit from improved reliability

- **Improved `products info` command behavior**:
  - Now respects the `--region` parameter properly
  - When `--region` is specified, shows only that region's information
  - When no region is specified, shows all regions in a table
  - CDN hosts are filtered to match the specified region
  - More intuitive and consistent with user expectations

- **Fixed `products cdns` command to filter by region**:
  - Now shows CDN configuration only for the specified region
  - Header indicates which region is being displayed
  - Shows both CDN hosts and servers for the region
  - Displays warning if no CDN configuration exists for the region
  - Consistent behavior across all output formats

- **Fixed `products info` command to display CDN servers**:
  - Now displays both CDN hosts and CDN servers sections
  - Collects unique servers from all filtered CDN entries
  - Shows server count in section headers
  - JSON output includes servers in CDN data
  - Consistent display format with CDN hosts

### Changed

#### `tact-client` crate

  - Added `with_user_agent()` method to set custom User-Agent headers
  - User agent is applied to all HTTP requests including retries
  - If not set, uses reqwest's default user agent
  - Example usage: `client.with_user_agent("MyGameLauncher/1.0")`

#### `ngdp-cdn` crate

- **Added custom user agent support**:
  - Added `with_user_agent()` method to `CdnClient`
  - Added `user_agent()` method to `CdnClientBuilder`
  - User agent is applied to all CDN download requests
  - If not set, uses reqwest's default user agent
  - Example usage via builder: `CdnClient::builder().user_agent("MyClient/1.0").build()`
  - Example usage via method: `CdnClient::new()?.with_user_agent("MyClient/1.0")`

### Fixed

#### `ngdp-cache` crate

- **Fixed CachedRibbitClient cache directory structure**:
  - Removed incorrect "cached" subdirectory from cache path
  - Cache now correctly uses `~/.cache/ngdp/ribbit/{region}/` instead of `~/.cache/ngdp/ribbit/cached/{region}/`
  - This aligns with the RibbitCache implementation for consistency
  - Updated example to reflect correct cache path

- Fixed example filename collisions across crates:
  - Renamed `basic_usage.rs` examples to unique names per crate
  - `ribbit-client`: `basic_usage.rs` → `ribbit_basic_usage.rs`
  - `tact-client`: `basic_usage.rs` → `tact_basic_usage.rs` and `retry_handling.rs` → `tact_retry_handling.rs`
  - `ngdp-cache`: `basic_usage.rs` → `cache_basic_usage.rs`
  - `ngdp-cdn`: `basic_usage.rs` → `basic_usage.rs` (kept as is, new crate)

  - Automatic sequence number extraction and tracking from responses
  - TTL strategies: 5 minutes for versions, 30 minutes for CDN configs and BGDL
  - Full async support with proper error handling
  - Important: This caches TACT metadata only, NOT actual CDN content files

### Documentation

#### `ngdp-cache` crate

- **Clarified TACT vs CDN caching distinction**:
  - Added comprehensive documentation explaining that TACT `/cdns` endpoint returns CDN configuration, not content
  - Documented that actual CDN content caching should use `~/.cache/ngdp/cdn/`
  - Added integration tests demonstrating proper cache isolation and structure

- **Merged TactCache into CdnCache**:
  - Removed separate TactCache module as it was duplicating CDN functionality
  - CdnCache now handles all CDN content types: config/, data/, patch/, and indices
