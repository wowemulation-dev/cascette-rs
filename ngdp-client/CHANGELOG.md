## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **TACT parser integration for build configuration analysis**:
  - Added `inspect build-config` command for detailed build configuration analysis
  - Downloads and parses real build configurations from CDN using tact-parser crate
  - Visual tree representation of game build structure with emoji and Unicode box-drawing
  - Shows core game files (root, encoding, install, download, size) with file sizes
  - Displays build information (version, UID, product, installer)
  - Patch status indication with hash display
  - VFS (Virtual File System) entries listing with file counts
  - Support for all output formats: text (visual tree), JSON, and raw BPSV
  - Example: `ngdp inspect build-config wow_classic_era 61582 --region us`

- **Enhanced products versions command with build configuration parsing**:
  - Added `--parse-config` flag to `products versions` command
  - Downloads and parses build configurations to show meaningful information
  - Displays build names instead of just cryptic hashes (e.g., "WOW-62417patch11.2.0_Retail")
  - Shows patch availability and file size information  
  - Counts VFS entries to indicate build complexity
  - Maintains full backward compatibility when flag is not used
  - Works across all WoW products (wow, wow_classic_era, wowt, etc.)
  - Example: `ngdp products versions wow --parse-config`

- **Dependencies**:
  - Added `tact-parser` (0.1.0) dependency for TACT file format parsing
